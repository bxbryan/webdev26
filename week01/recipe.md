## Instructions
1. Add whiskey, lemon juice, simple syrup, and egg white to a shaker.
2. **Dry shake** (so no ice) for 10–15 seconds to emulsify the egg white.

4. Strain into chilled coupe or rocks glass.
5. (Optional) Garnish with lemon twist or cherry.

## Notes
- For a lighter foam, shake longer during the dry shake.
- The egg white is the soul to me. Please, make it nice and foamy with an egg white if possible.
